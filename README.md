BENEATH the SURFACE
=======

"BENEATH the SURFACE" is the result after 48 hours of intensive game development during the 29th edition of [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/). It is a polar platformer; inspired by [Super Hexagon](http://superhexagon.com/) and other Ludum Dare game I don't remember anymore.

You are FASCINATED by complex systems. But this one is special. Is more complex and more... attractive? Keep breaking through to discover the truth; not about "the system", but about yourself.

You can play the game from [its official webpage](http://www.sismicos.net/ld29/) ([también en español](http://www.sismicos.net/ld29/esp/)) and its [Ludum Dare webpage](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=rate&uid=7620).

### Controls

* Up array in mid-air to double jump.
